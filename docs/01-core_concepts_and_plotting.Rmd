# Geospatial Data in R

## Geographic Data

are data with  *locations* on or near the surface of the *Earth*.

<img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/ee/Anatone_WA.jpg/640px-Anatone_WA.jpg"></img>


## Geospatial data

represent location more specifically with **coordinates**

`46.130479, -117.134167`
  
<img width="600px" src="./images/anatone_google.png"></img>


## Coordinate Reference Systems

Coordinates only make sense when associated with a CRS!

<img width="700px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/62/Latitude_and_Longitude_of_the_Earth.svg/640px-Latitude_and_Longitude_of_the_Earth.svg.png"></img>

Geographic Coordinates: `Latitude` and `Longitude`

## Coordinate Reference Systems

Define:

- the shape of the Earth

- the origin (0,0 point)

- the relationship between the system and the real world

- the units

*Because of variations in these, there are **many** geographic CRSs!*

## WGS84

The [World Geodetic System of 1984](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Geodetic_System) is the most widely used geographic coordinate reference system.

`WGS84` is the default CRS for most GIS software

Almost all longitude and latitude data are assumed to be **WGS84** unless otherwise specified

*Historical data much trickier*

## Geospatial data are powerful!

You can 

- dynamically determine spatial metrics like area, length, distance and direction

- spatial relationships like intersects, inside, contains, etc 

and

- link data by location, like census data and crime data

## Spatial Data

Spatial data is a broader term than geographic data. 

Methods for working with spatial data are valid for geospatial data 

All spatial data are encoded with some type of coordinate reference system

Geospatial data require the CRS to be a model of locations on the Earth

# Types of Spatial Data

## Types of Spatial Data

Vector and Raster Data


## Vector Data

Points, lines and Polygons

<img width="800px" src="./images/vector_data.png"></img>

## Raster Data

Regular grid of cells (or pixels)

<img width="800px" src="./images/raster_data.png"></img>

*We cover raster data only in Day 3 of this workshop*

# Software for working with Geospatial Data

## Geospatial data require

software that can import, create, store, edit, visualize and analyze geospatial data

- represented as geometric data objects *referenced to the surface of the earth via CRSs*
    
- with methods to operate on those representations

## GIS

We call software for working with geospatial data **GIS**

**Geographic Information System**

This term is commonly associated with desktop software applications.

## Types of GIS Software

Desktop GIS - `ArcGIS`, `QGIS`

Spatial Databases - `PostgreSQL/PostGIS`

Web-based GIS - `ArcGIS Online`, `CARTO`

Software geospatial data support - `Tableau`

Programming languages with geospatial data support 

- `R`, `Python`, `Javascript`

## Geospatial Data in R

There are many approaches to and packages for working with geospatial data in R.

One approach is to keep it simple and store geospatial data in a data frame.

This approach is most common when 

- the data are point data in CSV files and

- you want to map rather than spatially transform or analyze the data 

## About the Sample Data

`sf_properties_25ksample.csv`

**San Francisco Open Data Portal**
[https://data.sfgov.org](https://data.sfgov.org)

[SF Property Tax Rolls](https://data.sfgov.org/Housing-and-Buildings/Assessor-Historical-Secured-Property-Tax-Rolls/wv5m-vpq2)

This data set includes the Office of the Assessor-Recorderâ€™s secured property tax roll spanning from 2007 to 2016.

We are using a subset of these data as a proxy for home values.

## Load the CSV file into a data frame

```{r, eval=F}
SFhomes <- read.csv('data/sf_properties_25ksample.csv', 
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Take a look at first 5 rows and a few of the columns
SFhomes[1:5,c("YearBuilt","totvalue","AreaSquareFeet","Neighborhood",
              "NumBedrooms")]

```
*Make sure your working directory is set to the folder where you downloaded the workshop files!*

##

```{r, eval=T}
SFhomes <- read.csv('data/sf_properties_25ksample.csv', 
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)

# Take a look at first 5 rows and a few of the columns
SFhomes[1:5,c("YearBuilt","totvalue","AreaSquareFeet","Neighborhood",
              "NumBedrooms")]

```
## Explore the data

```{r, eval=F}
class(SFhomes)            # what is the data object type?
dim(SFhomes)              # how many rows and columns
str(SFhomes)              # display the structure of the object
head(SFhomes)             # take a look at the first 10 records
summary(SFhomes)          # explore the range of values
summary(SFhomes$totvalue) # explore the range of values for one column
hist(SFhomes$totvalue)    # histogram for the totvalue column
```

## Questions:

- What columns contain the geographic data?
- Are these data vector or raster data?
- What type of geometry do the data contain? 
    - Points, lines, polygons, grid cells?
- What is the CRS of these data?


## Plot of points

Use the R base `plot` function to create a simple map

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(SFhomes$lon, SFhomes$lat) # using base plot function
```

## Plot of points

Use the R base `plot` function to create a simple map

```{r}
plot(SFhomes$lon, SFhomes$lat) # using base plot function
```


# ggplot2

## `ggplot2`

Most widely used plotting library in R

Not specifically for geospatial data

But can be used to make fabulous maps

Great choice if you already know `ggplot2`


## `ggplot2`

Load the library

```{r}
library(ggplot2)
```

## Maps with `ggplot2`

Basic map with ggplot

```{r, eval=F}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot() + geom_point(data=SFhomes, aes(lon,lat))

```


## Maps with `ggplot2`

Basic map with ggplot

```{r}
ggplot() + geom_point(data=SFhomes, aes(lon,lat), size=1)
```


## Coord_map Option

```{r}
ggplot() + geom_point(data=SFhomes, aes(lon,lat), size=1) + coord_map()
```

## coord_map option

Allows you to associate a map projection with geographic coord data.

<img src="./images/coord_map_help.png" width="600px"></img>

## Map Projections

`Map Projection`: mathematial transformation from curved to flat surface

<img width="600px" src="./images/projection.gif"></img>

A `Projected CRS` applies a **map projection** to a Geographic CRS

## Many Map Projections & Projected CRSs

All introduce distortion, 

- in shape, area, distance, direction, or combo

- the larger the area the greater the distortion

No one map projection best for all purposes

Selection depends on location, extent and purpose

##  Different Projected CRSs

<img height="500px" src="./images/diff_crs.png"></img>

## `coord_map("mercator")`

`Mercator` is the default map projection used by the `get_coord()` function.

- You don't have to specify it!

It's important to know that you can customize the map projection and parameters if you wish.

But doing this is beyond the scope of this workshop.

## Map points symbolized by `totvalue`

*Data driven symbology*
```{r, eval=F}
ggplot() + geom_point(data=SFhomes, aes(lon,lat, col=totvalue)) + 
  coord_map()
```


## Map points symbolized by `totvalue`

```{r, echo=F}
ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data=SFhomes, aes(lon,lat, col=totvalue), size=1) + 
  coord_map()
```

## Data Order

*What's happening here?*  


```{r, eval=F}
SFhomes_low2high <- SFhomes[order(SFhomes$totvalue, decreasing = FALSE),]

ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data=SFhomes_low2high, aes(lon,lat, col=totvalue)) + 
  coord_map()
```

Try it - Does the output map look different from previous one?


## Data Order

The order of the data in the data frame changes the map display!

```{r, echo=F}
SFhomes_low2high <- SFhomes[order(SFhomes$totvalue, decreasing = FALSE),]

ggplot() + 
  geom_point(data=SFhomes_low2high, aes(lon,lat, col=totvalue)) + 
  coord_map()
```


## More `ggplot` Goodness

What does this code do?
```{r, eval=F}
SFhomes2010_15 <- subset(SFhomes_low2high, as.numeric(SalesYear) > 2009)

ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(lon, lat, col=totvalue), data = SFhomes2010_15 )  +
  facet_wrap(~ SalesYear)
```

## More `ggplot` Goodness

Visual spatial analysis!
```{r, echo=F}
SFhomes2010_15 <- subset(SFhomes_low2high, as.numeric(SalesYear) > 2009)

ggplot() +
  geom_point(aes(lon, lat, col=totvalue), data = SFhomes2010_15 )  +
  facet_wrap(~ SalesYear)
```



## Map Overlays

Let's add another geospatial data layer to our map. 

You can use this method to add as many layers as you want to a `ggplot`.

*Map overlay is the fundamental technique of visual geographical analysis.*


## Bart Stations and Landmarks

Use the `read.csv` function to read in a file of Bart Station locations. What is the name of the column with the longitude values? latitude?

```{r}
bart <- read.csv("./data/bart.csv")

# take a look
head (bart)
```

## Subset for year 2015
For the maps from here on out, to deal with a smaller example dataset, we're going to also subset our data
for only those rows that pertain to year 2015.

```{r}
SFhomes15 <- subset(SFhomes_low2high, as.numeric(SalesYear) == 2015)
```


## Add BART stations to map
```{r, results="hide"}
sfmap_with_bart <- ggplot() +
  geom_point(data=SFhomes15, aes(x=lon, y=lat, col=totvalue))  +
  geom_point(data=bart, aes(x=X,y=Y), col="red", size=3) 
```

## Add BART stations to map
```{r }
sfmap_with_bart
```

## Add BART stations to map

Let's just display SF BART Stations
```{r, results="hide"}
sfmap_with_bart <- ggplot() +
  geom_point(data=SFhomes15, aes(x=lon, y=lat, col=totvalue))  +
  geom_point(data=bart[bart$CO=='SF',], aes(x=X,y=Y), col="red", size=3) 
```

## Add BART stations to map

Are the higher valued homes near BART?
```{r }
sfmap_with_bart
```

## Add BART stations to map

What could we do to improve our map?
```{r }
sfmap_with_bart
```


## Any Questions?
<img width="600px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/b/b5/David_S._Pumpkins_dance.jpg"> </img>

## Let's add one more layer

*SF Landmarks*

`data/landmarks.csv`

## SF Landmarks

```{r}
landmarks <- read.csv("./data/landmarks.csv")
head(landmarks)
```

## Map Landmarks

Let's create a map of the SF homes, BART Stations and Landmarks all together.

```{r, results = "hide"}
sfmap_bart_landmarks <- ggplot() +
  geom_point(data=SFhomes15, aes(x=lon, y=lat))  +
  geom_point(data=bart[bart$CO=='SF',], aes(x=X,y=Y), col="red", size=3) +
  geom_point(data=landmarks, aes(x=X,y=Y), shape=22, 
             col="black", fill="grey", size=4)
```

## Map Landmarks

*All good - are all layers displayed?*  If not, why not?
 
```{r, echo=F}
sfmap_bart_landmarks
```

# ggplot is a powerful tool for creating maps!


## BUT!

There are limits to what you can do with geospatial data stored in a `data frame`.

- i.e. where there is no specific geospatial data object(s)
```{r}
head(landmarks)

```


## Can't transform Coordinate Data

The Landmark data do not have geographic coordinates - longitude and latitude.

You can't transform these coordinate data with `ggplot`.

```{r}
ggplot() +
  geom_point(data=landmarks, aes(x=X,y=Y), shape=22, 
             col="black", fill="grey", size=4)
```

## Can't read & plot geospatial data files

The ESRI Shapefile is the most common file format for geospatial data.

<img src="./images/shapefile.png" width="400px"></img>

`ggplot` cannot **directly** read in or plot shapefile data.

- *though you can do it with a round-about set of commands* :(

## Can't Perform Spatial Analysis

 `ggplot` can't answer questions like

- *What properties are in the Noe Valley neighborhood?*

- *What is the average property value in each SF neighborhood?*

- *What is the area of each SF Neighborhood and the property density?*

- *What properties are within walking distance (.25 miles) of the Mission neighborhood?*

You need libaries that support `spatial data objects` and `spatial methods` for that!

# Spatial Data Objects in R

## `sf` package

`sf` stands for 'simple features', which is a standard (developed by the Open
Geospatial Consortium) for storing various geometry types in a hierarchical data model.

A 'feature' is just a representation of a thing in the real world (e.g. a building, a city...). 

In other words, each feature consists of both a **geometric representation** of an object
and **some associated information** (building: height, name, etc..., city: population, area, etc...).

## `sf` vs. `sp`

`sf` is a relatively new package. 

`sf` supersedes the package `sp` and its ecosystem of related packages (mainly 
`rgeos` and `rgdal`). As such, it is a one-stop shop for core geospatial data objects
and operations that used to be spread across those 3 packages.

`sp` is still frequently used, but its spatial objects are a bit less streamlined.
It will be necessary for our raster work on Day 3, so we'll see a bit of it then.

## `sf` package

Here are the most common simple features geometries,
which are used to represent vector data in `sf`.

## `sf` package

`sf` offers numerous specific benefits, including:

* fast IO (**I**nput and **O**utput)
* enhanced plotting
* integration with R data structures (it uses `data.frame`s)
* integration with tidyverse packages, `%>%` piping syntax
* consistent function names (all starting with `st_` for spatial type)
* increasingly supported by other geospatial packages (e.g. `tmap`, `ggplot`)
* aligned with other GIS software that use simple features (e.g. QGIS, PostGIS) or a similar data model (e.g. Python's Geopandas)


## `sf` package

First, of course, we'll need to load the package:

```{r}
library(sf)
```

## `sf` objects: IO

We can then read in a spatial dataset into an `sf` object using  the `st_read` function.

Let's start with a shapefile of San Francisco census tracts.

*First take a look at the file...*
```{r}
dir("data", pattern = "sftracts.")
```

## `sf` objects: IO

Now let's use the `sf` function `st_read` to load the file in R.
```{r}
tracts = st_read(dsn = './data', layer = 'sftracts')
```

## `sf` objects: structure

Then, as always, we can explore the basic aspects of the object returned,
using base R functions:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
#the object displays a compact summary, when its name is called
tracts
```

## `sf` objects: structure

```{r, eval=T, echo=F}
#the object displays a compact summary, when its name is called
tracts
```

## `sf` objects: structure

What sort of object is this?
```{r, eval=F}
class(tracts)
```

## `sf` objects: structure
```{r}
# the object is of both the 'sf' and 'data.frame' classes
class(tracts)
```

## `sf` objects: structure

It has a number of columns (i.e. attributes, fields), including a geometry column
```{r}
str(tracts)
```

## `sf` objects: structure

We can use basic data.frame functions on it

```{r}
nrow(tracts)
colnames(tracts)
head(tracts, 4)
```

## `sf` objects: basic plotting

We can plot an `sf` object using its plot method.

In other words, when we just call R's base `plot` function on an `sf` object,
R will recognize that it's an `sf` object and thus plot it accordingly.

```{r, eval=F}
plot(tracts)
```

## `sf` objects: basic plotting

```{r}
plot(tracts)
```


## `sf` objects: basic plotting

Note that we get an array of plots, one for each variable
(or 'field', or 'attribute') in our dataset (up to the first 9).

So then we should be able to plot a single variable by just subsetting
the `sf` dataframe for that variable, then plotting the subsetted dataframe.

```{r, echo=F}
plot(tracts)
```



## Challenge 

Plot just the 'NAME' column's data.

(Note: This will be an example of what we call a 'choropleth' map.)


## Challenge: Solution

```{r}
#read in a shapefile of SF census tracts
plot(tracts['NAME'])
```


## Challenge: Solution

Some of you may have gotten this plot instead:

```{r}
plot(tracts$NAME)
```

## Challenge: Solution

What went wrong?

```{r}
class(tracts['NAME'])
class(tracts[, 'NAME'])
class(subset(tracts, select='NAME'))
class(tracts$NAME)
```

## Challenge: Solution

When we use bracket syntax or the subset function,
`sf` objects return new, subsetted `sf` objects.

But when we use the '$' notation, we just get a vector of the column's values!

As always, we need to **be careful and check what kinds of objects we're working with!**

```{r}
head(tracts$NAME)
head(tracts['NAME'])
```


## `sf` objects: geometries

The nice thing about `sf` objects is that they are just `data.frame`s!

The geometry data is just stored in its own special column,
usually named `geom` or `geometry`.

<br>

For the most part, we will not want to manually manipulate the data in the geometry column. But when we're just getting started, it can be revealing to tinker a bit.


## `sf` objects: geometries

As we saw earlier, the geometry data is stored in its own column.
Let's take a closer look at that column:

```{r, eval=F}
tracts$geometry
```

## `sf` objects: geometries

```{r}
tracts$geometry
```


## `sf` objects: geometries

One thing we can see is that our CRS and some other metadata is stored as part of this column.
This includes:

* the geometry type and its dimensionality
* the bounding box,
* the CRS arguments
* the CRS' EPSG code (which we'll learn about in a bit)

```{r}
tracts$geometry[[1]]
```

## `sf` objects: geometries

Of course, all the geometries in the column must have the same CRS.

We can check the CRS of an `sf` object using the `st_crs` function:

```{r}
st_crs(tracts)
```


## `sf` objects: geometries

And we can get our bounding box using `st_bbox`,
or subset certain values:

```{r}
bbox = st_bbox(tracts)
bbox
bbox$xmin
```

## `sf` objects: geometries

We can also see that this column is some sort of special object.

Unlike with the 'NAME' column, when we subset
the 'geometry' column with '$' we don't just get a vector of values.

Of course, we _can't_ just get a vector, because the values are
complex objects (geometries). 

Instead, we get a __"list column"__.


## `sf` objects: geometries

So, what sort of object is this?

```{r}
class(tracts$geometry)
```
An `sfc` object!

This is short for 'simple features collection', which is
basically just an R `list` of geometries (because as we just said,
a vector wouldn't work).

## `sf` objects: geometries

So then, what sort of object is each individual geometry?

(Note the **double-bracket** notation, which indexes values out of a `list`.
Single brackets would just return us a new, subsetted list---in this case, a new,
subsetted `sfc` object.)

```{r}
class(tracts$geometry[[1]])
```
It's an object of the `XY`, `MULTIPOLYGON`, and `sfg` classes!

## `sf` objects: geometries

Here's what those classes mean:

- `sfg` is short for 'simple features geometry'; this is the geometry data itself!

- `XY` just indicates the dimensionality of that geometry (for all our purposes this will
  be `XY`, but some less commonly used data models include a `Z` dimension)

- `MULTIPOLYGON` just indicates the type of that geometry (which, as we saw earlier, could also be `POINT`, `LINESTRING`, ...)


## `sf` objects: geometries

A simple features geometry is typically either stored as well-known text (WKT) or well-known binary (WKB).

The latter is more easily machine-readable. But the former is human-readable, and is what we see in an `sf` geometry column.


## `sf` objects: geometries

The WKT is just a very simple written representation of the 'connect-the-dots' vector data model.

Here's a point: `POINT (2 4)`

Here's a multipoint: `MULTIPOINT (2 2, 3 3, 3 2)`

Here's a linestring: `LINESTRING (0 3, 1 4, 2 3)`

And here's a polygon: `POLYGON ((1 0, 3 4, 5 1, 1 0))`

(Notice that the polygon's first and last coordinate-pairs are the same!)

## `sf` objects: geometries

Now, if we look at one of our geometries again it should be clearer what data it contains and what it represents.

```{r}
tracts$geometry[[1]]
```

Why is our data of the type `MULTIPOLYGON`?


## `sf` objects: summary

And that is the full anatomy of an `sf` object!

To recap:

 * `sf` objects are `data.frame` objects with special 'geom' or 'geometry'
columns..
 * The geometry column is a simple features collection (`sfc`) object.
 * Each value in an `sfc` is a simple features geometry (`sfg`) object.

(From the [`sf` docs](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/articles/sf1.html.))


## `sf` objects: summary

Here's a more technical depiction (from the [`sf` Github Repo](https://github.com/r-spatial/sf)):

<img src="./images/sticky_geometries.jpg" width="650px"></img>

## `sf` objects: summary

Now, if we look at our census tracts again,
hopefully you can see all the pieces.

```{r}
tracts
```


## `sf` objects: plotting

So what about our homes data? Let's plot them with the tracts data!

To do that, we'll need to use ggplot (because the homes data is not an sf object).
The `geom_sf` function will allow us to add data from an `sf` object to a ggplot.

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot() + geom_sf(data = tracts) +
geom_point(data = SFhomes15, aes(lon, lat, col = totvalue))
         
```

## `sf` objects: plotting

```{r}
ggplot() + geom_sf(data = tracts) +
geom_point(data = SFhomes15, aes(lon, lat, col = totvalue))
         
```


## `sf` objects: plotting

What happened?

Our data wound up at totally opposite ends of our map!

Why?



## `sf` objects: plotting

What's the CRS of our census tracts?...
```{r}
st_crs(tracts)
```

And what's the CRS of the SF homes data?...
```{r}
st_crs(SFhomes15, n = 1)
```

**We can't plot our data if it's not in the same CRS!**



## CRS Problems

The #1 reason...

<img width="600px" src="./images/not_working.jpeg"></img>


## Reconciling projections

Every spatial object needs a reference to its CRS.

If it is lacking this reference, we'll need to **define** it.

Note the **important difference** between *defining* and *transforming* projections!

**Defining** just makes a spatial object aware of the CRS of its geometries. (This does not change the data's coordinate values.)

**Transforming** converts the geometries to a new CRS. (This changes the coordinate values.)


## Reconciling projections

So we need our data all in the same projection.
In order to do this, we're going to need to do 3 things:

1. Make our homes an explicitly geospatial object, using `sf`.

2. **Define** (or assign, or set) that object's CRS.

3. **Transform** (or reproject) one of our two objects to the CRS of the other.


## Creating `sf` objects

First, we need to coerce our homes data to an `sf` object.

But we can do this in a single line of code, using the `st_as_sf` function!


## Creating `sf` objects

To do this, we need to provide 3 pieces of information to 3 arguments:

__x__: The object to be converted to an `sf` object

__coords__: The columns containing the coordinates.

__crs__: The CRS of the coordinates contained in those columns.


## Coordinate Reference Systems

In order to this, we need to know the CRS of our homes data.

So, what is it?...


## CRS Definitions and Transformations

GIS software will have a database of definitions for thousands of Earth-referenced
CRSs and methods for using those definitions to define or transform a CRS.

We just need to know how to specify our data's CRS
(unprojected lat/lon with a WGS84 ellipsoid and datum) in terms that
will allow R to correctly indentify it within that database.


## Referencing the WGS84 CRS

To do this, we can create a `proj4` string, as follows:

`st_crs("+proj=longlat +ellps=WGS84 +datum=WGS84")`

The `proj4` string is a standard format used across a wide variety of GIS.


## EPSG codes

However, the `proj4` string is long and complicated, and leaves a lot of room for error.
And there are *lots* of CRSs out there!

So the **E**uropean **P**etroluem **S**urvey **G**roup devised a simpler system
of numerical codes, called **EPSG** codes.

The longlat, WGS84 EPSG code is 4326.

So we could create our CRS instead using just the EPSG code in a proj4string:

`st_crs("+init=epsg:4326")`

Which, in `sf`, can be simplified even further:

```{r}
st_crs(4326)
```


## Proj4 CRS Definitions

Here is some additional info on CRS definitions, for your reference:

[Proj4](http://proj4.org/) is the standard library for defining and transforming map projections and coordinate reference systems.

[Here](https://github.com/OSGeo/proj.4/blob/master/nad/epsg) is an example file of proj4 CRS definitions


## Common CRS Codes

And here are some common codes:

**Geographic CRSs**

* `4326` Geographic, WGS84 (default for lon/lat)

* `4269` Geographic, NAD83 (USA Fed agencies like Census)


**Projected CRSs**

* `5070` USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area Conic

* `3310` CA ALbers Equal Area

* `26910` UTM Zone 10, NAD83 (Northern Cal)

* `3857` Web Mercator (web maps)


## Finding CRS Codes

And here's a resource for looking up EPSG codes and proj4 strings,
should you need to:

[http://spatialreference.org/](http://spatialreference.org/)


## Creating `sf` objects

Now that we know our homes have are in unprojected coordinates with a WGS84 datum
(i.e. EPSG code: 4326), we can call `st_as_sf` as follows:

```{r}
SFhomes15_sf = st_as_sf(SFhomes15, coords = c('lon', 'lat'), crs = 4326)
```

## Check it

We can check the object type by displaying a summary.
```{r}
SFhomes15_sf
```

## Check it

We can specifically check the CRS with `st_crs`:

```{r}
st_crs(SFhomes15_sf)
```

Looks good!



## Reprojecting

That takes care of both steps 1 (create `sf` object) and 2 (define CRS)!

Now that our homes are an `sf` object with the correctly defined CRS, we'll need to **reproject**
either `SFhomes15_sf` or `tracts`, so that they are in the same projection.

## Reprojecting

We want all data in the same CRS.

Which one is best???

<img src="./images/shrugging_baby.jpg" width="400px"></img>

## Reprojecting

There's no universally right answer to that question.
Usually the answer will depend on what operations you plan to run downstream.

In our case, we'll reproject our tracts,
so that everything is in an unprojected CRS and plots with units of decimal degrees.


## Reprojecting

**Note**: If we were working with `sp` objects, we would use the `rgdal` package
to carry out CRS transformations.

However, `sf` provides a one stop shop for all sorts of common geospatial operations,
so we can just stick with `sf` functions.


## Reprojecting

Using `sf`, we can **reproject**, or **transform** an `sf` object
using the `st_transform` function.

The only arguments we need are:

* The object to be transformed

* The target CRS to transform x to (which can be provided as just an integer of the EPSG code)

Syntax...
```{r,eval=F}
new_sf_object = st_transform(original_sf_object, crs=target_crs_epsg_code)
```


## Challenge

Transform the `tracts` object to the same CRS as the `SFhomes15_sf` object.
Name the new object `tracts_lonlat` (to indicate that its CRS is unprojected
longitude and latitude).


## Challenge: Solution

We can transform the tracts to the CRS of SFhomes15\_sf using:

```{r}
tracts_lonlat = st_transform(tracts, crs = 4326)
```


## Challenge: Solution

However, note that if we want to be super explicit, to be certain things match up,
we can index the EPSG code directly out of SFhomes15\_sf's CRS object, as follows:

```{r}
tracts_lonlat = st_transform(tracts, crs = st_crs(SFhomes15_sf)$epsg)
```

## Compare the CRSs, again

Are they both defined? Are they the same?

```{r}
st_crs(SFhomes15_sf)
st_crs(tracts_lonlat)
st_crs(SFhomes15_sf) == st_crs(tracts_lonlat)
```


## `sf` objects: plotting

And now we can try again to plot our data together.

(Note that we can ues the `aes` function to do aesthetic mapping
in an `geom_sf` call, just as we could with `geom_point` and other ggplot functions.)

```{r, eval=F}
ggplot() + geom_sf(data = tracts_lonlat) + 
           geom_sf(data = SFhomes15_sf, aes(col = totvalue))
```

## `sf` objects: plotting

Success!

```{r, echo=F}
ggplot() + geom_sf(data = tracts_lonlat) + 
           geom_sf(data = SFhomes15_sf, aes(col = totvalue))
```

## Challenge

Work through the following steps:

1. Transform the landmarks `dataframe` to an `sf` object,
   setting its CRS to EPSG: `3857`, which is the code for Web Mercator.

2. Read in the 'SFboundary' and 'SFhighways' shapefiles, from the './data' subdirectory.

3. Reproject any of those layers to the CRS of SFhomes15\_sf, as needed.

4. Plot tracts, boundary, highways, homes, and landmarks together.
   Make the border purple, and the highways and the landmarks red.
   Color the homes by the 'totvalue' column.


## Challenge: Solution

1: Transform the landmarks `dataframe` to an `sf` object,
   setting its CRS to EPSG: `3857`, which is the code for Web Mercator.

```{r}
landmarks_sf = st_as_sf(landmarks, coords = c('X', 'Y'), crs = 3857)
```

## Challenge: Solution

2: Read in the 'SFboundary' shapefile, from the './data' subdirectory.

```{r}
SFboundary = st_read('./data', 'SFboundary')
SFhighways = st_read('./data', 'SFhighways')
```

## Challenge: Solution

3: Reproject any of those layers to the CRS of SFhomes15\_sf, as needed.

`SFboundary` doesn't need to be transformed

```{r}
#check the CRS of SFboundary
st_crs(SFboundary) == st_crs(SFhomes15_sf)
```
## Challenge: Solution

3: Reproject any of those layers to the CRS of SFhomes15\_sf, as needed.

`SFhighways` needs to be transformed

```{r}
#check th CRS of SFhighways
st_crs(SFhighways) == st_crs(SFhomes15_sf)
#it needs to be transformed
SFhighways_lonlat = st_transform(SFhighways, st_crs(SFhomes15_sf))
```
## Challenge: Solution

3: Reproject any of those layers to the CRS of SFhomes15\_sf, as needed.

We know `landmarks` does, because we just assinged it EPSG 3857.

```{r}
landmarks_lonlat = st_transform(landmarks_sf, st_crs(SFhomes15_sf))
```


## Challenge: Solution

4: Plot tracts, boundary, highways, homes, and landmarks together.
   Make the border purple, and the highways and the landmarks red.
   Color the homes by the 'totvalue' column.

```{r}
challenge_map = ggplot() +
geom_sf(data = SFboundary, col = 'purple') +
geom_sf(data = tracts_lonlat, alpha = 0.2) +  #alpha = 0.2 for transparency, so we can see SFboundary
geom_sf(data= SFhighways_lonlat, col = 'red') +
geom_sf(data = SFhomes15_sf, aes(col = totvalue)) +
geom_sf(data = landmarks_sf, col = 'red')
```

## Challenge: Solution

```{r}
challenge_map
```

## Challenge: Solution

Excellent! Everything lines up!



# Plotting: `tmap` package

## plotting: getting fancy

How do we manipulate more of the aspects in our plots?

How do we make our plots prettier?

What other options do we have for plotting `sf` objects?

For this, we'll turn to __`tmap`__.


## `tmap`

We've already mapped with base R's `plot`, `ggplot`, and `sf:plot`.

We've seen how to control some plot aesthetics, to make our maps data-rich.

We will continue to explore similar functionalities. But we'll do so using the `tmap` package.

We won't spend a ton of time reviewing `tmap`, because you'll get more practice with
it in Parts 2 and 3.


## `tmap`

As we will see, `tmap` offers some crucial additional options:

- integration with spatial objects (i.e. `sf` and `sp` objects)
- easy interactive maps

## `tmap`

`tmap` stands for thematic map

It's a powerful toolkit for creating maps with `sf` and `sp` objects,
with less code than the alternatives

Syntax inspired by ggplot2 (but a bit simpler)


## `tmap`

First we'l load the library

```{r}
library(tmap)
```

*Note*: You may need to install /load dependencies
- ggplot2, RColorbrewer, classInt, leaflet libraries

```{r, echo=F, message=F}
tmap_mode('plot')
```

## `tmap`: quick tmaps

We can create **q**uick **tm**aps with the `qtm` function:

```{r}
qtm(SFhomes15_sf)
```

## `tmap`: modes

`tmap` has 2 modes:

* **plot**: makes static maps

* **view**: makes interactive maps

Use the command `tmap_mode` to toggle between them:

* `tmap_mode("plot")`

* `tmap_mode("view")`


## `tmap`: modes

We can create an interactive version of the previous map: 

```{r, eval=F}
tmap_mode("view") # set tmap to interactive view mode
qtm(SFhomes15_sf) # Interactive - click on the points
```


## `tmap`: modes

Notice that this is a live, interactive map!  Click to see Popups! Click on the Layer Selector!

```{r, echo=F, message=F}
tmap_mode("view")
qtm(SFhomes15_sf)
```

## `tmap`: modes

Conveniently, we can also toggle between the modes using the `ttm` function.

```{r}
ttm()
ttm()
ttm()
ttm()
```

## `tmap`: building custom maps

To customize our tmaps, we need to use `tmap`'s more complex, `ggplot`-type  syntax

```{r, eval=F}
tm_shape(tracts) + 
  tm_polygons(col="beige", border.col="red", alpha=0.5)
```

`tm_shape(<sf_object>)`  specifies the sf object

`+ tm_<element>(...)`  specifies the symbology

plus other options for creating a publication ready map


## `tmap`: mapping polygons

We can add and customize polygons using `tm_polygons`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tm_shape(tracts) + 
  tm_polygons(col="beige", border.col="red", alpha = 0.4)
```

## `tmap`: mapping polygons

```{r }
tm_shape(tracts) + 
  tm_polygons(col="beige", border.col="red", alpha = 0.4)
```

## tmap: plot mode

Switch back to 'plot' mode

* Remember how?

## `tmap`: mapping points

We can also map and customize `point` data using `tm_dots`

`tm_dots` are a type of `tm_symbols()`

See `?tm_symbols` for other types of point symbols.

```{r, eval=FALSE}

tm_shape(SFhomes15_sf) + 
  tm_dots(col="skyblue", border.col="red",size=.25)

```

## `tmap`: mapping points

```{r}
tm_shape(SFhomes15_sf) + 
  tm_dots(col="skyblue", size=.25)
```


## `tmap`: mapping lines

And we can add and customize lines using `tm_lines`.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tm_shape(SFhighways_lonlat) + 
  tm_lines(col="black")
```

## `tmap`: mapping lines

```{r}
tm_shape(SFhighways_lonlat) + 
  tm_lines(col="black")
```


## `tmap`: data driven mapping

Like `ggplot`, we can use data values to drive the symbology

But two important differences:

* we don't use an `aes` aesthetic-mapping function
* we must `quote` our column names!

```{r, eval=F}
tm_shape(SFhomes15_sf) + 
  tm_dots(col="totvalue", size=.25) 
```

## `tmap`: data driven mapping

```{r}
tm_shape(SFhomes15_sf) + 
  tm_dots(col="totvalue", size=.25) 
```


## `tmap`: mapping multiple layers

We can overlay multiple `sf` objects, or layers,
by concatenating the `tmap` commands with plus signs
(again, using `ggplot`-style syntax).

```{r}
# Map the SF Boundary first
overlay_map = tm_shape(SFboundary) + 
  tm_polygons(col="beige", border.col="black") +

# Overlay the highway lines next
tm_shape(SFhighways_lonlat) + 
  tm_lines(col="black") +
  
# Then add the house points
tm_shape(SFhomes15_sf) + 
  tm_dots(col="totvalue", size=.25) 

```

## `tmap`: mapping multiple layers

```{r}
overlay_map
```


## `tmap`: mapping multiple layers

What if we then want to add our landmarks? Does this code work?

```{r, eval=F}
overlay_map +
    tm_shape(landmarks_lonlat) +
    tm_dots(col = 'skyblue', size = 2)
```

## `tmap`: mapping multiple layers

Yup!

```{r, echo=F}
overlay_map +
    tm_shape(landmarks_lonlat) +
    tm_dots(col = 'skyblue', size = 2)
```


## `tmap`: CRS management

Can we redo it using `landmarks_sf` instead of `landmarks_lonlat`?

```{r, eval=F}
overlay_map +
    tm_shape(landmarks_sf) +
    tm_dots(col = 'skyblue', size = 2)
```

## `tmap`: CRS management

Yup!  What does that tell us about `tmap`?

```{r, echo=F}
overlay_map +
    tm_shape(landmarks_sf) +
    tm_dots(col = 'skyblue', size = 2)
```


## `tmap`: CRS management

`tmap` reprojects on the fly!

If the CRSs are defined, `tmap` will use that info - if not, `tmap` will assume `WGS84` -

and dynamically reproject subsequent layers to match first one added to map.



## `tmap`: advanced customization

We can of course tweak all sorts of details in our maps.

```{r, eval=F}
tm_shape(SFboundary) +
  tm_polygons(col="beige", border.col="black") +
  
tm_shape(SFhighways_lonlat) + 
  tm_lines(col="black") +
  
tm_shape(SFhomes15_sf) + 
  tm_dots(col="totvalue", size=.25, 
          title = "San Francisco Property Values (2015)") + 
tm_layout(inner.margins=c(.05, .2, .15, .05)) 
      # bottom, left, top, right
```

## `tmap`: advanced customization

```{r, echo=F}
tm_shape(SFboundary) +
  tm_polygons(col="beige", border.col="black") +
  
tm_shape(SFhighways_lonlat) + 
  tm_lines(col="black") +
  
tm_shape(SFhomes15_sf) + 
  tm_dots(col="totvalue", size=.25, 
          title = "San Francisco Property Values (2015)") + 
tm_layout(inner.margins=c(.05, .2, .15, .05)) 
      # bottom, left, top, right
```

## `tmap`: advanced customization

We can also customize the popups!

Notice the changes relative to the previous code.

```{r, eval=F}
tmap_mode('view')
tm_shape(SFboundary) + 
  tm_polygons(col="beige", border.col="black") +
  
tm_shape(SFhighways_lonlat) + 
  tm_lines(col="black") +

tm_shape(SFhomes15_sf) + 
  tm_dots(col="totvalue", size=.05, 
          title = "San Francisco Property Values (2015)",
          popup.vars=c("SalesYear","totvalue","NumBedrooms",
                       "NumBathrooms","AreaSquareFeet")) + 
  
tm_layout(inner.margins=c(.05, .2, .15, .05)) # bottom, left, top, right
```

## `tmap`: advanced customization

```{r, echo=F, message=F}
tmap_mode('view')
tm_shape(SFboundary) + 
  tm_polygons(col="beige", border.col="black") +
  
tm_shape(SFhighways_lonlat) + 
  tm_lines(col="black") +

tm_shape(SFhomes15_sf) + 
  tm_dots(col="totvalue", size=.05, 
          title = "San Francisco Property Values (2015)",
          popup.vars=c("SalesYear","totvalue","NumBedrooms",
                       "NumBathrooms","AreaSquareFeet")) + 
  
tm_layout(inner.margins=c(.05, .2, .15, .05)) # bottom, left, top, right
```

## `tmap`: advanced customization
And we can access a wide variety of basemaps. 

Here's the list:
<http://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/>

Let's try watercolor!

```{r, eval=FALSE}
tm_basemap("Stamen.Watercolor") +
tm_shape(SFhomes15_sf) + 
tm_dots(col="totvalue", size=.05, title = "San Francisco Property Values (2015)") +
tm_tiles("Stamen.TonerLabels")
```

## `tmap`: advanced customization

Let's try watercolor!

```{r, echo=F, message=F}
tmap_mode('view')
tm_basemap("Stamen.Watercolor") +
tm_shape(SFhomes15_sf) + 
tm_dots(col="totvalue", size=.05, title = "San Francisco Property Values (2015)") +
tm_tiles("Stamen.TonerLabels")
```

## `tmap`

`tmap` provides support for so many different types of maps, check out the *tmap: get started* guide, `vignette("tmap-getstarted")`, linked in the documentation.

```{r, eval=F}
#Check out the tmap: get started! guide
?tmap
```

# Any Questions?


## `tmap`: saving and sharing maps

We can use the `tmap_last` function to grab the last map we made.

Here, we save it to a named variable ('map1'), then display it.

```{r}
fav_map <- tmap_last()
```

## `tmap`: saving and sharing maps

Then we can display it.

```{r}
fav_map
```

## `tmap`: saving and sharing maps

And then we can use `tmap_save` to save it.

Let's save in a couple formats, then look at them.

*Note*: We can specify the output format by just using the file extension!

```{r, eval=F}
tmap_save(fav_map, "./output/SF_properties.png", height=6) # Static image file with
tmap_save(fav_map, "./output/SF_properties.html") # interactive web map
```

## `tmap`: saving and sharing maps

There are many ways to publish your maps.

You can share you map online by publishing it to [RPubs](https://rpubs.com).

- You need to have an RPubs account to make that work.

1. Enter the name of your tmap object (`map1`) or your  `tmap` code in the console

2. In the `Viewer` window, click on the **Publish** icon.
