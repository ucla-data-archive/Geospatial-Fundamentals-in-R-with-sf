## Part II Prep

1. Open the repo at <https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Geospatial-Fundamentals-in-R-with-sf>
    - Download and unzip the zip file
    - Take note of where the folder is located

2. Start RStudio and open a **new script**, or **./docs/02-spatial_analysis.Rmd**

3. Set your working directory to the folder you unzipped 

4. Install the required libraries in RStudio, ONLY IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THEM ALREADY!
```{r, eval=F}
our_packages<- c("ggplot2", "dplyr", "sf", "units", "tmap")
for (i in our_packages) {
  if ( i %in% rownames(installed.packages()) == FALSE) {
    install.packages(i)
  }
}
```
5. Open the slides, **./docs/02-spatial-analysis.html**, in your browser (or click the "Part 2 Slides" link the repo).


## Part II Overview

Recap Part I

Tour of Spatial Analysis

## Part I Recap

In Part I, we:

- Loaded geospatial data from CSV files
- Mapped data with `ggplot`
- Promoted data frames to `sf` objects with `sf::st_as_sf`
- Loaded geodata from shapefiles with `sf::st_read`
- Explored `CRSs` with `sf::st_crs`
- Transformed CRSs with `sf::st_transform`
- Mapped data with `tmap`

## R Spatial Libraries

Let's load the libraries we will use

```{r, eval=FALSE}
library(sf)     # spatial objects and methods
library(tmap)   # mapping spatial objects
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
library(sf)     # spatial objects and methods
library(tmap)   # mapping spatial objects
```
 
## Set your working directory

Use `setwd` to set your working directory to the location of the tutorial files.

For example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd("~/Documents/Dlab/workshops/2018/rgeo/r-geospatial-workshop/r-geospatial-workshop")
```


## Reload Part I data

You may want to reload the data that we had in our workspace at the end of Part I.

We've provided a little script for doing that, which you can run using the following line of code:

```{r, results='hide'}
source('./docs/reload_part_01_data.R')
```

# Spatial Analysis

## The Spatial Analysis Workflow

1. Mapping / plotting to see location and distribution

2. Asking questions of, or querying, your data

3. Cleaning & reshaping the data

4. Applying analysis methods

5. Mapping analysis results

6. Repeat as needed


## Transform data to common CRS

In order to perform spatial analysis we need to first convert all data objects to a common CRS.

Which type? Projected or Geographic CRS?


## Geographic vs. Projected CRS

If my goal is to create maps, I may convert all data to a geographic CRS.

- Why?  Which one?

If my goal is to do spatial analysis, I will convert to a projected CRS.

- Why? Which one?


## Common CRS EPSG Codes

**Geographic CRSs**

* `4326` Geographic, WGS84 (default for lon/lat)

* `4269` Geographic, NAD83 (USA Fed agencies like Census)


**Projected CRSs**

* `5070` USA Contiguous Albers Equal Area Conic

* `3310` CA ALbers Equal Area

* `26910` UTM Zone 10, NAD83 (Northern Cal)

* `3857` Web Mercator (web maps)


## Transform all layers to UTM 10N, NAD83

Use `st_transform` to transform `SFhomes15_sp` and `bart` to `UTM 10N, NAD83`

- `SFhighways` and `SFboundary` already have this CRS

Recall, this transformation is called `projecting` or `reprojecting`

The `EPSG` code is **26910**, units are meters.

## Transform all layers to UTM 10, NAD83

First, transform `SFhomes15_sp`

(*Remember, this is also called `reprojecting`.*)

Note the two methods for doing same thing:

```{r}
#highways are already in 26910!
st_crs(SFhighways)

#so we can use them as the target CRS
SFhomes15_utm <- st_transform(SFhomes15_sf, st_crs(SFhighways))

#OR we could just use the EPSG code directly
#SFhomes15_utm <- st_transform(SFhomes15_sf, 26910)
```

## Transform the boundary?

```{r}
# Check the CRS
st_crs(SFboundary) == st_crs(SFhomes15_utm)

# Transform
SFboundary_utm <- st_transform(SFboundary, st_crs(SFhomes15_utm))

# Check again
st_crs(SFboundary_utm) == st_crs(SFhomes15_utm)
```

## BART data - Challenge

Transform the `bart_sf` object to UTM 10N.

Name the new object `bart_utm`

## Challenge: Solution

```{r}

# Transform Bart to UTM
bart_utm <- st_transform(bart_sf, st_crs(SFhomes15_utm))
```


## Check

Do the CRSs all match?

```{r}
st_crs(bart_utm)$epsg
st_crs(SFboundary_utm)$epsg
st_crs(SFhighways)$epsg
st_crs(SFhomes15_utm)$epsg
```

## Map all layers

Visual check

```{r, error=T}
plot(SFboundary_utm)
lines(SFhighways, col='purple', lwd=4)
points(SFhomes15_utm)
plot(bart_utm, col="red", pch=15, add=T)
```

## Map all layers

What happened?

Two things:

1. Remember, by default, `sf`'s `plot` method will plot a grid of maps,
   one for each variable in the `data.frame`!
2. We can't just plot `sf` objects directly with calls to R's `lines` and `points` functions.

## Map all layers

However, we can get what we want easily, with the help of the `st_geometry` function:

```{r}
plot(st_geometry(SFboundary_utm))
plot(st_geometry(SFhighways), col='purple', lwd=4, add = T)
plot(st_geometry(SFhomes15_utm), add = T, pch = 19, cex = 0.5)
plot(st_geometry(bart_utm), col="skyblue", pch=19, cex = 1, add=T)
```


## Challenge (Optional / time permitting)

Create the same plot, as closely as possible, using `tmap`.


## Challenge: Solution

```{r}
challenge_map = tm_shape(SFboundary) +
  tm_polygons() +
tm_shape(SFhighways) +
  tm_lines(col = 'purple', lwd = 4) +
tm_shape(SFhomes15_sf) +
  tm_dots(col = 'black', size = 0.5) + 
tm_shape(bart_utm) +
  tm_dots(col = 'skyblue', size = 1)
```

## Challenge: Solution

```{r, echo=F, message=F}
tmap_mode('plot')
```

```{r}
challenge_map
```

# Spatial Queries

## Spatial Queries

There are two key types of spatial queries

- **spatial measurement** queries, 
    - e.g. area, length, distance


- **spatial relationship** queries, 
    - e.g. what locations in A are also in B.

These types are often combined, e.g.

- What is the area of region A that is within region B?

# Spatial Measurement Queries

## Computing Area

What is the area of San Francisco?

What data would we use to answer that question?

## Area of San Francisco

- Use `sf::st_area` to compute the area of `sf` objects with polygons

- Check results against Wikipedia for [SF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco)

```{r}
sf_area = st_area(SFboundary_utm)
sf_area
```

## Area of San Francisco

How did it manage to give us the units?

That comes from the [`units` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/units/index.html), which `sf` imports and uses!

```{r}
class(sf_area)
typeof(sf_area)
```

## Area in sq km

Compare to the Wikipedia page's area for [SF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/San_Francisco)
 
```{r}
sf_area / (1000 * 1000) # Convert to square KM

```

## Area in sq km

That number is right, but now we've got an annoying little problem: Our value in square
kilometers is labeled as square meters!

The `units` package, an `sf` dependency, provides a better way.

```{r}
library(units)
set_units(sf_area, km^2)
```


## Area in sq km

The function `valid_udunits` will give us a table of the valid units we could convert to:

(Note that the 'ud' comes from the `udunits` package, a dependency of the `units` package.)

```{r}
head(valid_udunits(), 2)
```


## Area of San Francisco

What if we gave `st_area` the SF boundary in an unprojected CRS?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
st_area(SFboundary)
```

## Area of San Francisco

```{r}
st_area(SFboundary)
```

`st_area` still gives us the measurement in a reasonable unit
(rather than squared decimal degrees).

(However, this isn't a reason not to choose a reasonable, projected CRS for our data! Still best practice.

(Also notice the slight difference in our answers. This is not an equal-area projection!)

```{r}
st_area(SFboundary_utm)
```

## Length of highways

Use the function `st_length` to compute length of linear geometries.
```{r}
st_length(SFhighways)
```

## Length of highways

Oh! We got the length of every segment, in meters.

How do we get the total length of highways, in km?

## Challenge

Calculate the total length of SF highways in our dataset, in km.


## Challenge: solution

```{r}
tot_length = set_units(sum(st_length(SFhighways)), km)
tot_length
```

## Perimeter

We can also calculate the perimeter of polygons, should we need it (though this is implemented in the `lwgeom` package, an `sf` dependency, rather than in `sf` itself.)

```{r}
perim = lwgeom::st_perimeter(tracts)
head(perim, 10)
```

## Distance

The `st_distance` will return the min distance between two geometries.

Compute the distance in kilometers between Embarcadero & Powell St Bart stations

(__NOTE__: You can always spot-check on [Google Maps](https://maps.google.com).)
```{r}
emb_pow_dist = st_distance(bart_utm[bart_utm$STATION == 'EMBARCADERO',],
                           bart_utm[bart_utm$STATION == 'POWELL STREET',])
emb_pow_dist = set_units(emb_pow_dist, km)
emb_pow_dist
```

## Distance

Take note of the print-out. What's up with the `[1,]` and `[,1]` around the value?

`st_distance` is going to calculate a matrix of pairwise distances, by default!
(We just happened to subset our `sf` object to two new objects, each with a single feature, i.e. row.)

Read the docs:
```{r, eval = F}
?st_distance
```

## Challenge

That means we can easily calculate the distance between all SF properties and Embarcadero station. So go ahead and do that!

## Challenge: solution

```{r}
dist2emb <- st_distance(bart_utm[bart_utm$STATION == 'EMBARCADERO',],
                     SFhomes15_utm)
dist2emb <- set_units(dist2emb, km)

# check output
length(dist2emb)
nrow(SFhomes15_utm)
head(dist2emb, 10)
```

## Challenge: solution

Different syntax, equivalent result:

__You could just nest your calls, if you'd like.__

```{r}
dist2emb <- set_units(st_distance(bart_utm[bart_utm$STATION == 'EMBARCADERO',],
SFhomes15_utm), km)

# check output
head(dist2emb, 10)
```
## Challenge: solution

Different syntax, equivalent result:

__You could also use the 'tidy' syntax, if you're into that!__

```{r}
dist2emb <- st_distance(bart_utm[bart_utm$STATION == 'EMBARCADERO',],
                     SFhomes15_utm) %>% set_units(km)
# check output
head(dist2emb, 10)
```



# Spatial Relationship Queries

## Spatial Relationship queries

**Spatial relationship queries** compare the geometries of two spatial objects in the same coordinate space (CRS).

Some example relationships:

<img width="400px" src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/55/TopologicSpatialRelarions2.png"></img>


## Spatial Relationship queries

There are many, often similar, functions to perform spatial relationship queries (can be confusing!).

These operations may return logical values, lists, matrices, dataframes, geometries or spatial objects

- you need to check what type of object is returned 

- you need to check what values are returned to make sure they make sense



## BART stations in SF?

This is a very common type of spatial query called a `point-in-polygon` query.

We can use the `st_within` function to answer this.

We'll start with the simplest question: __Are there BART stations in SF?__

We already know the answer, but let's see how it's done.

## Are there any BART stations in SF?

What does it return by default?

```{r}
bart_stations_in_sf <-st_within(bart_utm, SFboundary_utm) 

head(bart_stations_in_sf)
```

## BART stations in SF?

The docs for the function (`?st_within`) explain that it returns a sparse-matrix
object by default.
This is more efficient, but more complicated to work with. For our purposes, let's disable this behavior:

```{r}
bart_stations_in_sf <-st_within(bart_utm, SFboundary_utm, sparse=F)

head(bart_stations_in_sf)
```

## BART stations in SF?

That's a bit more obvious! Looks like we got a logical value for each BART station.

Let's check the object's size:

```{r}
dim(bart_stations_in_sf)
dim(bart_utm)
```

## BART stations in SF?

So, to answer the simple question, we just need to know if there's at least one `TRUE`
in that list.

```{r}
T %in% bart_stations_in_sf
```

## Which Bart stations are in SF?

What about this question?

We can use the same output, but now leverage its station-by-station structure!

## Challenge

Return the names of the BART stations that are within SF.

## Challenge: solution

```{r}
bart_utm[bart_stations_in_sf, ]$STATION
```


## Which Bart stations are in SF?

And of course, there are multiple ways to do a thing!

We could also use the `st_intersection` function to get similar results.

```{r}
sfbart_utm = st_intersection(bart_utm, SFboundary_utm)
sfbart_utm
```


## Map the SF BART stations

```{r, eval=F}
tmap_mode("view")

tm_shape(SFboundary_utm) + 
  tm_polygons(col="beige", border.col="black") +
tm_shape(sfbart_utm) + 
  tm_dots(col="red")
```

## Map the SF BART stations

```{r, message=F, echo=F}
tmap_mode("view")

tm_shape(SFboundary_utm) + 
  tm_polygons(col="beige", border.col="black") +
tm_shape(sfbart_utm) + 
  tm_dots(col="red")
```


## Reset `tmap` to plot mode


```{r}
tmap_mode("plot")
```

## st_within vs st_intersects vs st_intersection
 
### Devil in the details...

`st_within` returns TRUE/FALSE, testing if one geometry is *completely* within another.

`st_intersects` returns TRUE/FALSE, testing if two geometries have any points in common.

`st_intersection` returns the geometry that intersects.

 
## `st_within`, `st_intersects`, `st_intersection`, and friends

- These were just a couple examples of common geometric queries used in spatial analysis.

- These, and other similar operations are neatly summarized on this great [`sf` cheatsheet](https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/blob/master/sf.pdf) (also available in the `./docs` subdirectory of our workshop repo):

<img src="./images/sf_cheatsheet_thumbnail.png" width="200px"></img>


## SF Census Tracts

Let's consider the `SFhomes15_utm` data along with the *SF census tract* data 
that we saw on day 1.

However, we are going to work with another version of the tract data, one that includes the population for each tract.


## Challenge

Read in the SF Census Tracts with pop data and call it `sftracts`

  - The filename is `sftracts_wpop.shp`.

  - The file is located in `./data`.
  
Then, create a population `choropleth map`.

## Challenge: solution
```{r}
#read in tracts
sftracts <- st_read("./data", "sftracts_wpop")
```

## Challenge: solution
```{r}
#plot
plot(sftracts['pop14'])
```


# Composite operations

## Composite operations

The remaining material will work through some common spatial anlysis tasks.

Each workflow will feature some combination spatial measurement operations, spatial relationship operations,
and other non-spatial operations.

## Joins and Aggregation

## Spatial join

A spatial join associates rows of data in one object with rows in another object based on the spatial relationship between the two objects.

A spatial join is based on the comparison of two sets of geometries in the same coordinate space. 

 - This is also called a **spatial overlay**.

## Spatial join

We could use any of a family of spatial relationships that all return matrices of logical values.

`sf` refers to these as 'geometric binary predicates', and collects all their documentation into one document, which we've already seen:

```{r, eval=F}
?st_within
```


## In what census tract is each property located?

We need to **spatially join** the `sftracts` and `SFhomes15_utm` to answer this.

What spatial object are we joining data from? to?

 
## Spatial join

We have points, which are pretty much certain to be either inside or outside polygons.
So we'll use `st_within` again as our spatial relationship.

We want to associate with each home the name of the census tract within which it falls.


## So here goes...

*In what census tract is each SF property located?* 

```{r, eval=F}
homes_with_tracts <- st_within(SFhomes15_utm, sftracts)
```

## Did it work?

If not, why not?


## CRSs must be the same

The `st_within` function, like almost all spatial analysis functions, requires that both data sets be spatial objects (they are) with the same coordinate reference system (CRS). Let's investigate

```{r, eval=F}

# What is the CRS of the property data?
st_crs(SFhomes15_utm)

# What is the CRS of the census tracts?
st_crs(sftracts)
```


## Transform the CRS

```{r}
#transform to UTM
sftracts_utm = st_transform(sftracts, st_crs(SFhomes15_utm))

# make sure the CRSs are the same
st_crs(sftracts_utm) == st_crs(SFhomes15_utm) 
```

Now let's try that overlay operation again

## Try 2

*In what tract is each SF property is located?*

```{r}
homes_with_tracts <- st_within(SFhomes15_utm, sftracts_utm)
```


## Review the `st_within` output

What is our output? Does it answer our question?

What type of data object did the over function return?

```{r, eval=F}
homes_with_tracts <- st_within(SFhomes15_utm, sftracts_utm)

class(homes_with_tracts)
length(homes_with_tracts)
nrow(sftracts_utm)
nrow(SFhomes15_utm)
```

## Review the `st_within` output

What do we have here?
```{r}
homes_with_tracts <- st_within(SFhomes15_utm, sftracts_utm)
class(homes_with_tracts)
length(homes_with_tracts)
nrow(sftracts_utm)
nrow(SFhomes15_utm)

```

## Review the `st_within` output
What the heck is an object of the class `sgbp`?

__Read the docs!__

(It's basically just a special sparse-matrix structure designed to hold the results
returned from these binary-predicate functions.)
```{r, eval=F}
?sgbp
```

## Review the `st_within` output

What data does the output object _store_?

```{r}
head(homes_with_tracts)
```

## Review the `st_within` output

We have a `list`, where each item's _index_ is a `SFhomes15_utm` property's index,
and each _value_ is the index of the `sftracts_utm` census tract within which it is found.

We're halfway there!

## Spatial join

We can now finish the operation by:

1. using that `st_within` output object to subset
the `sftracts_utm` `data.frame`;

2. grabbing the desired columns from that subsetted `data.frame` and adding
   them to our `SFhomes15_utm` `data.frame`.

In our case, the desired column will just be the `GEOID` column (a standardized ID
that we can then use to link up to non-spatial census data).

## Add the GEOID column

*CAUTION: this only works because the data are in the right order!*
```{r}
SFhomes15_utm$home_geoid <- sftracts_utm[unlist(homes_with_tracts),]$GEOID

```

## Check the result

```{r}
head(SFhomes15_utm, 2)
```

## Check the result

```{r}
join_map = tm_shape(sftracts_utm) +
  tm_polygons() +
tm_shape(SFhomes15_utm) +
  tm_dots(col = 'home_geoid', size = 0.25)
```

## Check the result

```{r, warning=F} 
#Note that tmap bins our tracts because we have so many
join_map
```


## WOW

Data linkage via space!

The `st_within` operation gave us the census tract data info for each point in `SFhomes15_utm`

We added the `GEOID` for each point to the `SFhomes15_utm` sf object.

We can now join `SFhomes15_utm` points by `GEOID` to any census variable, eg median household income, and then do an analysis of the relationship between, for example, property value and that variable.

**How would we do that?**

# Attribute Joins

## Attribute Joins

`Attribute joins` merge data in two tables based on matching data values contained in a column in each table.

For example we could join a table of student grades with a table of student names and addresses if both tables contain a column with student id.


## Read in the census data

Let's read in a CSV file of median househould income for SF tracts.

The `sf_med_hh_income2015.csv` file only has two columns: `GEOID` and `medhhinc`.

Because `GEOIDs` can have leading zeros, we set the `colClasses` to make sure they are not stripped.
```{r}
med_hh_inc <- read.csv("data/sf_med_hh_income2015.csv", stringsAsFactors = F, 
                       colClasses = c("character","numeric"))

head(med_hh_inc)
```

## Joining a regular `data.frame` to an `sf` `data.frame`

We can use `merge` to join the `med_hh_inc` DF to the `SFhomes15_utm` `sf` object.

We should make sure that they share a column of common values - GEOID / home_geoid

## Joining a regular `data.frame` to an `sf` `data.frame` 

Join two data objects based on common values in a column.

Use `merge` to join two `data.frame`s. 

(Notice, again, that our `sf data.frame` will conveniently behave
just like regular old `data.frame` in this way.)

```{r}
#make sure we're using `base` `merge` (because multiple other packages
#that you might have read in also have a `merge` function)
SFhomes15_utm <- base::merge(SFhomes15_utm, 
                       med_hh_inc, by.x="home_geoid", by.y="GEOID")
```

## Take a look at output

```{r}
head(SFhomes15_utm, 2) # Look for the col medhhinc
```


## Check the `merge` results

```{r, message=F}
tmap_mode("view")
tm_shape(SFhomes15_utm) + tm_dots(col="medhhinc")
```

## The Census Tract Perspective

We now know the census tract for each property.

Now let's think about this question from the tract perspective. 

Let's ask the question

- What is the average propety value per tract?



## Non-Spatial Aggregation

Since we joined GEOID to each property we can use the non-spatial `aggregate` function to compute the mean of totvalues for each GEOID.

But we'll use `sf`'s spatial implementation of aggregate.

We'll start by...

Reading the docs!

```{r, eval=F}
?sf::aggregate.sf
```

## sf::aggregate.sf

We see that we can provide arguments:

- __`x`__: `sf` object to be aggregated

- __`by`__: can be another `sf` object whose geometries will generate the groupings

- __`FUN`__: function to be used to summarize the grouped values


## What is the mean home value in each census tract?
```{r}
tracts_with_mean_val <- aggregate(x = SFhomes15_utm["totvalue"], 
                                  by = sftracts_utm,
                                  FUN = mean)
```

Wow, so simple. What does that give us?


## Examine output of `sf::aggregate.sf`

```{r}
class(tracts_with_mean_val)
head(tracts_with_mean_val, 2)
nrow(tracts_with_mean_val) == nrow(sftracts_utm)
```

## sf::aggregate.sf output

`sf::aggregate.sf` returned a new `sf data.frame`.

The new `data.frame` has the same geometry as `sftracts_utm`

But it only contains one column, with the mean `totvalue` for each tract.

To make these data more useful, let's add this value to `sftracts_utm`!

## 

__Note__: This only works because there are the same number of elements in both
`data.frame`s and they are in the same order!
```{r}

sftracts_utm$mean_totvalue <- tracts_with_mean_val$totvalue

head(sftracts_utm, 2) # check it
```

## Map it 

Map the results to make sure they seem reasonable.

(__NOTE__: This is called a 'choropleth' map.)

```{r}
choropleth = 
tm_shape(sftracts_utm) +
  tm_polygons(col="mean_totvalue", border.col=NA)
```

## Map it 

```{r}
choropleth
```


## Why no values for some tracts?
```{r}
choropleth + tm_shape(SFhomes15_utm) + tm_dots(size = 0.01)
```



## Proximity Analysis

Many methods of spatial analysis use distance to select features. For example...

*What properties are within walking distance of BART?*

In order to select properties with 1KM of BART, we can:

1. create a 1km-radius buffer polygon around each BART point

2. do a point-in-polygon operation to either count the number of properties within the buffer or compute mean values.

## Create the buffers 

For this, we'll use---surprise, suprise---`st_buffer`.

But first, we'll...

Read the docs!
```{r, eval=F}
?st_buffer
```

## Create the buffers

It takes as input:

* __x__: an `sf*` object or objects to be buffered;
* __dist__: a buffer distance.

## Create the buffers

Let's assume 1km is our 'standard walking distance'.
```{r}
#remember: our units are meters!
bart_1km_buffer <- st_buffer(sfbart_utm, dist=1000)
```

## Map the buffers
```{r}
tm_shape(bart_1km_buffer) + tm_polygons(col="red") +
tm_shape(sfbart_utm) + tm_dots()
```

## What properties are within 1km of a bart station?

What operation can we use here?

Once again, we can use `st_intersects` or `st_intersection`

## What properties are within 1km of a bart station?

```{r}
SFhomes_near_bart <-st_intersection(SFhomes15_utm, bart_1km_buffer)

# Take a look
head(SFhomes_near_bart)
```

## Plot it
```{r}
tmap_mode('view')
tm_shape(bart_1km_buffer) + tm_borders(col="red") +
tm_shape(sfbart_utm) + tm_dots() +
tm_shape(SFhomes_near_bart) +
tm_dots(col = 'green', size = 0.03)
```



# Any Questions?


## Summary

That was a whirlwind tour of just some of the methods of spatial analysis.

There was of course a lot we didn't and can't cover.
