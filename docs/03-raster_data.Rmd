## Part III Prep

1. Open the repo at <https://github.com/dlab-berkeley/Geospatial-Fundamentals-in-R-with-sf>
    - Download and unzip the zip file
    - Take note of where the folder is located

2. Start RStudio and open a **new script**, or **./docs/03-raster_data.Rmd**

3. Set your working directory to the folder you unzipped 

4. Install the required libraries in RStudio, if you do not have them already

```{r, eval=F}
install.packages(
  c("ggplot2", "ggmap", "sf", "units", "tmap", "nngeo", "raster"),
  dependencies=TRUE)
```
5. Open the slides, **./docs/03-raster_data.html**, in your browser (or click the "Part 3 Slides" link the repo).

## Part III Overview

Review basic raster concepts

Read in our previous spatial data and new raster data

Make some raster and combined raster-vector maps

Run some raster and raster-vector operations and analyses

## R Spatial Libraries

Let's load the libraries we will use

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(sf)     # simple features objects and methods
library(tmap)   # mapping spatial objects
library(raster) # reading in and operating on rasters
```
 
## Set your working directory

Use `setwd` to set your working directory to the location of the tutorial files.

For example:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
path = "/path/to/your/working_directory"
setwd(path)
```

# Load some files from Parts I and II

## SF Census Tracts

```{r}
# Read in the 'sftracts_wpop' shapefile
sftracts <- st_read("./data", "sftracts_wpop")
```

## SF Properties 2015

```{r}
# Read in from CSV file
SFhomes <- read.csv('./data/sf_properties.csv', 
                    stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
# subset the data
SFhomes15 <- subset(SFhomes, as.numeric(SalesYear) == 2015)

# coerce to an `sf` object
SFhomes15_sf <- st_as_sf(SFhomes15, coords = c('lon', 'lat'),
                                                  crs = 4326)
#Reproject to the sftracts projection
#NOTE: We're overwriting the previous SFhomes15_sf object here! This is
#fine to do if we want, but we should always beware.
SFhomes15_sf = st_transform(SFhomes15_sf, st_crs(sftracts))

#check projection equality
st_crs(SFhomes15_sf) == st_crs(sftracts)
```

# Section 1: Raster Data in R

## Read in a Raster

Using the fabulous `raster` package

```{r}
# Reading in and plotting raster files

#read in a Bay Area DEM (Digital Elevation Model)
#(from http://www.webgis.com/terr_pages/CA/dem1/sanfrancisco.html)
DEM = raster('./data/san_francisco-e.DEM')
```

## Plot it

Make a quick map of the data to check it out
```{r}
#plot it
plot(DEM)
```

## Explore the Structure

To see a summary of the structure and content of a `RasterLayer` object,
we can just enter the object's name.

```{r}
DEM
```
You can view more detail in the RStudio Environment pane.

## Explore the Structure

A raster should really just be a matrix of data, with metadata assiging
it the correct location on the Earth's surface, right?

In a `raster` object, the data and metadata will all be saved in their own
'slots', which are indexed by '@' rather than '$'.

('Slots' are components used to organize 'S4' objects. 'S4' is a data-type commonly
used by third-party packages to define their own special data structures.)

## Explore the Structure

Here's some of the important metadata.

```{r}
DEM@extent
DEM@crs
DEM@ncols
```

## Explore the Structure

And notice that the `DEM` object is indeed an 'S4' object.

```{r}
class(DEM)
typeof(DEM)
```

## Explore the Structure

Note that a `raster` object's structural organizaion and string-representation (the bit that is printed
to the screen when you call the variable's name) are fundamentally different
from those of `sf` objects.


## Explore the Structure

For example, a `RasterLayer` has information on the resolution.

```{r}
DEM
```

## Explore the Structure

What does the resolution mean?

```{r}
(DEM@extent@xmax - DEM@extent@xmin) / DEM@ncols
(DEM@extent@ymax - DEM@extent@ymin) / DEM@nrows
DEM
```
It's the cell-size! That is, the real-world distance of the x and y sides of
each cell (i.e. pixel) in our `RasterLayer`, expressed in the distance units
of the object (as determined by its projection).

## Explore the Structure

As for our matrix of data, it should live somewhere inside the `@data` slot, right?

```{r}
str(DEM@data)
```

## Explore the Structure

There's a bunch of stuff there. Let's take a look at the `@data@values` slot...

```{r}
DEM@data@values
```
## Explore the Structure

What happened there? How can our data be `logical(0)`?
Where's our data?

```{r}
DEM@data@inmemory
DEM@data@fromdisk
```

It appears our data was not all read into memory. Instead, our `RasterLayer` object
contains a pointer to where that data is held on disk (to save memory).

## Explore the Structure

How do we see the values, then?

Well, we can still subset the values, using two-dimensional subsetting notation, just
as we'd expect for a matrix.

```{r}
DEM[10:15, 20:30]
```
And we'll get back a vector of the values from that subsetted matrix, unfolded.

## Explore the Structure

We can even subset the entire thing, getting back all of the values.

```{r}
DEM[,]
```

## Explore the Structure

And we could even then turn that vector back into a matrix of the proper dimensions.

```{r}
#coerce our whole raser's dataset to a matrix, with the appropriate number
#of columns, and 
matrix(DEM[,], ncol = ncol(DEM), byrow = TRUE)
```

Notice that we were able to use `ncol` on our `RasterLayer` object, because in some 
basic senses it behaves like a `matrix`, much as a `Spatial*DataFrame` behaves in some
senses like a `data.frame`.

## Explore the Structure

Can we create a new `RasterLayer` object from a matrix?

```{r}
test = raster(matrix(DEM[,], ncol = ncol(DEM), byrow = TRUE))
test
```

We do get a new `RasterLayer`! However, notice that it of course has no
projection, and has incorrect extent and resolution.

## Explore the Structure

You can imagine that you could then use
the DEM object's information to assign the new `RasterLayer` its appropriate metadata
(much like what we did with unprojected point data that we read in from a CSV and
coerced to an `sf` object).

Because there's a much easier way to do all of this...

## Explore the Structure

Our subsetting operation can actually take a `drop = FALSE` argument!

```{r}
DEM[10:15, 20:30, drop = FALSE]
```

And this gives us back a new RasterLayer object! 

In essence, this makes the subsetting operation more or less like a basic **clipping** function.

## Explore the Structure

Here's what that gave us:

```{r}
test = DEM[10:15, 20:30, drop = FALSE]
plot(test)
```

## Explore the Structure

And now what does the `@data@values` slot look like in our new object now?

```{r}
test@data@values
```

## Explore the Structure

That makes sense, because our test object didn't come from a file, so R
didn't leave its data on disk.

```{r}
test@data@inmemory
test@data@fromdisk
```

## CRS Transformations

Check the CRS (aka projection) of the DEM raster data.

Transform (or reproject) the Tracts vector data to match it.

```{r}
#check out its projection
proj4string(DEM)

#reproject tracts to our DEM projection
sftracts_NAD = st_transform(sftracts, st_crs(DEM))
```

## CRS Transformations

You can reproject the DEM with `raster::projectRaster`

Note how the syntax is similar to `sp::spTransform`

```{r, error=T}
DEM_WGS = projectRaster(DEM, projectExtent(DEM, st_crs(sftracts)))
```

## CRS Transformations

Oops! What went wrong?

That's not a very informative error message...

Let's read the docs!

```{r, eval=F}
?projectRaster
```

## CRS Transformations

Looks like projectRaster expects the `crs` argument needs to be an object
of the 'CRS' class.

Is it?

```{r}
class(st_crs(sftracts))
```

## CRS Transformations

We need to be careful when working between the `raster` and `sf` packages, because
`raster` is older and still depends on `sp`.

This object is of the `crs` class. But check out the class of _this_ object!

```{r}
class(crs(st_crs(sftracts)$proj4string))
```

## CRS Transformations

__What did we do there?__

That has multiple nested steps. From the inside, out:

1. call `sf::st_crs` to get the CRS of sftracts;
2. index out its `proj4string` using `$` notation;
3. feed that into the `raster::crs` function, to create a CRS object of the
   correct class

```{r, eval=F}
class(crs(st_crs(sftracts)$proj4string))
```

## CRS Transformations

That's an object of the `CRS` class,
which is even indicated as belonging to the `sp` package!

Now we can see that `raster` is still expecting spatial objects to be
expressed in classes defined by the `sp` package.

(Maybe this will change in the future, if `raster` integrates `sf` support.
But for the time being, we'll need to be aware of and manage this mismatch.)


## CRS Transformations

So, clearly, a solution would be to replace the broken bit of code
with the expression we used that _did_ give us a `CRS` object.

```{r}
DEM_WGS = projectRaster(DEM, projectExtent(DEM, crs(st_crs(sftracts)$proj4string)))
```

## CRS Transformations
Then  we can check equivalence.
```{r}
st_crs(sftracts_NAD) == st_crs(DEM)
st_crs(DEM_WGS) == st_crs(sftracts)
```




#################################

## `sp` package

As we mentiond in Part I, `sp` was for a long time the primary geospatial package in R.

`sf` has now eclipsed this package (along with the 'rgdal' and 'rgeos' packages).

However, as you can see, not all geospatial packages have made the transition already.

## `sp` package

You may sometimes run into issues such as the one we just experienced, where you can find an easy workaround.

Other times, however, you may actually need to work with `sp` objects instead of `sf` ones.

Luckily, this is easy!

## `sp` package

To convert __from `sf` to `sp`__, `sf` provides the `as_Spatial` function.

Let's convert `SFhomes15_sf`, then look at its string representation.

Note that it looks very similar to the metadata of a `raster` object.

```{r}
SFhomes15_sp = as_Spatial(SFhomes15_sf)
SFhomes15_sp
```

## `sp` package

And look at its structure, which is also similar.

```{r, eval=F}
str(SFhomes15_sp)
```

## `sp` package

That makes sense, because the `raster` and `sp` packages are designed to feel as
standardized and consistent as possible.

There _are_ differences, however!

Some are just stylistic:

- `@bbox` instead of `@extent`
- `@proj4string` instead of `@crs`

Some come from the difference between the vector and raster data models:

- no `dimensions` attribute
- no `resolution` (this _is_ a concept for vector data, but is not key metadata)
- the `@data` slot is a `data.frame` (a.k.a. an "attribute table")


## `sp` package

`sp` creates objects that pertain to any of a number of classes,
which conform to the `Spatial*DataFrame` convention:

- `SpatialPointsDataFrame`
- `SpatialLinesDataFrame`
- `SpatialPolygonsDataFrame`
- etc.

## `sp` package

`Spatial` objects can then be transformed, subsetted, analyzed, and plotted,
using a variety of packages that may not be compatible (yet?) with `sf`.

Here's a plot:

```{r}
plot(SFhomes15_sp)
```

## `sp` package

And if you need to convert __from `sp` to `sf`__,
there's a function for that too (which we already saw in Part 1!).

```{r}
SFhomes15_sfagain = st_as_sf(SFhomes15_sp)
plot(SFhomes15_sfagain['totvalue'])
```

## `sp` package

We will not go into any greater detail on `sp` in this workshop.

However, if you find you need to learn more then please visit our
[former R geospatial workshop](https://github.com/dlab-geo/r-geospatial-workshop),
which is based on `sp`.

(It uses the same data and runs more or less the same operations as this workshop,
so it should be easy to follow and should highlight all the differences between `sf` and `sp`.)


## Clipping Rasters

Since the raster data covers a larger area than our vector data / area of interest,
we can clip it using the `raster::crop` function.

```{r}
# clip the WGS CRS version of the rasters to sftracts 
DEM_WGS_crop = crop(DEM_WGS, sftracts)

# Clip the NAD CRS version
DEM_crop = crop(DEM, sftracts_NAD)
```

## Plot Clipped Raster data

You can plot raster and vector
```{r}
plot(DEM_WGS_crop)
 
```

## Plot Raster & Vector Data

And we can plot raster and vector data together!

Here we plot the NAD CRS version.
```{r, warning=F}
#plot together
plot(DEM_WGS_crop)
plot(sftracts, add = T, col = NA)
```

## Masking Raster Data

Notice that the clipping (or cropping) operation reduced our dataset
to just the extent of the census-tract dataset.

But it still left us with
values outside of the census tracts themselves (because they are areas outside
the city of San Francisco).

## Masking Raster Data

For some purposes, we may want to get rid of those
values as well. 

We can do this with an operation called **masking**.

```{r}
DEM_WGS_crop_masked = mask(DEM_WGS_crop, sftracts)
```

## Masking Raster Data

Here's what that gives us, compared to the unmasked object:

```{r}
DEM_WGS_crop_masked
DEM_WGS_crop
```

## Masking Raster Data

Still a rectangular grid of cells (because a raster will __always__ be rectangular).

Still has the same `nrow` and `ncol` as the unmasked object. 

What masking did was to set the cells that lie outside our dataset to NAs.


## Masking Raster Data

```{r}
plot(DEM_WGS_crop_masked)
plot(sftracts, add = T, col = NA)
```

## Plotting rasters in `tmap`

We can make an interactive plot using `tmap`

```{r, message=F}
my_map <- tm_shape(DEM_WGS_crop_masked) +
  tm_raster() +
tm_shape(sftracts) + 
  tm_borders() +

# Set mode to interactive
tmap_mode("view")
```

## View Map
```{r}
my_map
```

## Writing Raster Data

And now that we've manipulated our data as desired, we can write it to disk
if we like!

```{r}
#write our reprojected, cropped data to the data directory, using the Geotiff format
#(and allow R to overwrite if file already exists)
writeRaster(DEM_WGS_crop_masked, filename="./data/DEM_reproject_crop.tif", format="GTiff", overwrite = T)
```



# Section 2: Raster Operations and Spatial Analysis

## Challenge section

This section will feature a number of challenges, to get you practicing some of the
material we've already covered today.

## Extract elevation values

We can use the raster::extract function to get the elevation values for each tract.

```{r}
# get the elevation for every cell in each of the census tracts
elev = extract(DEM_WGS_crop, sftracts)

#what did that give us?
head(elev)

```


## What is the output?

Check out the data in the `elev` object
```{r}
length(elev)
nrow(sftracts)
```
It's a vector of the elevations for all the cells within each census tract!


## Average Raster value by Vector shape

Let's get each tract's average elevation
```{r}
mean_elev = lapply(elev, mean, na.rm = T)
head(mean_elev)
```

## Add elevation to Vector object

Let's add this to the sftracts_NAD `data.frame`.

__Note__: the order remains the same, so we can just add this right in!

```{r}
sftracts$mean_elev = unlist(mean_elev)
```


## Map it
```{r}
#what did we get?
elev_map <- tm_shape(sftracts) + 
  tm_polygons(col = 'mean_elev') +
  tm_layout("The pain of biking in SF, by census tract", 
            inner.margins=c(0,0,.1,0), title.size=4.8)
```

## Map it

```{r}
elev_map
```

## One step Re-do

We can also pass a function argument to `raster::extract`
```{r}
elev = extract(DEM_WGS_crop, sftracts, fun=mean)

#what did that give us?
head(elev)
```

## Questions?

Do you see the difference between those two approaches?

1. Mapping a vector layer on top of a raster layer (i.e. `my_map`)
2. Summarizing raster values by vector polygons, then mapping the polygons (`elev_map`)


## Challenge 1: Read in and check out new data

You have another raster dataset in your `./data` directory. The file is called
`nlcd2011_sf.tif`.

This is data from the [National Land Cover Database (NLCD)](https://www.mrlc.gov/nlcd11_leg.php).

It's 2011 data that was downloaded from [here](https://viewer.nationalmap.gov/basic).

Read that file in as an object called `nlcd`, and plot it.


## Solution

```{r}
#read in nlcd data
nlcd = raster('./data/nlcd2011_sf.tif')

#plot nlcd
plot(nlcd)
```

## Let's see what's in the NLCD data

```{r}
freq(nlcd)
```

## ... and a barplot

(__Note__: The colors in this barplot have no relation to the colors in our maps!
Just pay attention to the categories on the x-axis.)

```{r}
barplot(nlcd)
```

## What do those values mean?

This is a categorical raster. Each cell on the raster holds a discrete (integer) value, coding a particular type of land-cover (rather than a continuous value, like we saw with our elevation data above).

Where do we do to figure out what the codes mean?
This should come with the metadarad that ships with your data,
or that is provided at the website where you downloaded it.

[Here](https://www.mrlc.gov/data/legends/national-land-cover-database-2011-nlcd2011-legend)'s the NLCD legend.


## Challenge 2: Reproject and crop our NLCD data

Now that we've read in our NCLD data, check if we need to reproject it (we want it to be in the same projection as our `sftracts` object), and project it if need be.

Then crop it to the extent of our `sftracts` object.

## Solution

```{r}
#check projection equality
st_crs(nlcd) == st_crs(sftracts)

#reproject
nlcd_WGS = projectRaster(nlcd, projectExtent(nlcd, crs(st_crs(sftracts)$proj4string)))

#check projection equality again
st_crs(nlcd_WGS) == st_crs(sftracts)

#crop
nlcd_WGS_crop = crop(nlcd_WGS, sftracts)

```

## Plot the new raster

```{r}
plot(nlcd_WGS_crop)
```

## Recovering our plot formatting

Notice that the colors of our original, which conveniently represented the NLCD class
colors from their website, are lost after reprojecting and cropping our raster.

Those colors were controlled by information in the original file,
which was read into the `@legend` slot. Here's the info (with hexadecimal format for color codes, e.g. '#00F900'):

```{r}
nlcd@legend
```

## Recover our plot formatting

What's the `@legend` slot in our reproject, cropped object look like?

```{r}
nlcd_WGS_crop@legend
```

## Recover our plot formatting

Well that's a bummer...

Is there a way we could transfer that information over to our reprojected, cropped raster?

## Challenge 3: Transferring our `@legend` info
Try to figure out how to transfer the `@legend` info from the original raster object to our new object. Then plot the new object to see if it worked.

## Solution

Nice! Not necessary... but nice!

```{r}
nlcd_WGS_crop@legend = nlcd@legend
plot(nlcd_WGS_crop)
```

## Reclassifying rasters

When we're working with a categorical raster, we'll often want to reclass our data. We may want to do this because:

- Our original data has more classifications than we actually need for our analysis.
- We want to represent the classifications we do have by a different numerical scheme because it somehow makes our analysis more convenient.

## Reclass the NLCD

Let's reclass our NLCD data. First we'll need to define a reclassification
matrix with 3 columns (low, high, to):

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?reclassify
```

## Define reclassification matrix 
```{r}
reclass_vec <- c(0, 20, NA, # water will be set to NA (i.e. 'left out' of our analysis)
                20, 21, 1, # we'll treat developed open space as greenspace, based on NLCD description
                21, 30, 0, # developed and hardscape will have 0s
                30, 31, NA, 
                31, Inf, 1) # greensapce will have 1s
reclass_vec
reclass_m <- matrix(reclass_vec, ncol = 3, byrow = TRUE)
reclass_m
```

## Reclassify the raster 
```{r}
nlcd_green <- reclassify(nlcd_WGS_crop, reclass_m)
```

## Reclassify the raster

What did we get?

```{r}
freq(nlcd_green)
```

## Reclassify the raster 

What did we get?

```{r}
barplot(nlcd_green)
```

## Reclassify the raster 

What did we get?

```{r}
plot(nlcd_green)
```

## Challenge 4: Extract our NLCD data to our tract polygons

Just like we did earlier with our elevation data, let's extract our reclassed
NLCD data to our census-tract polygons.

## Solution

```{r}

#extract the mean nlcd_simple values to tract polygons
greenspace = extract(nlcd_green, sftracts, fun=mean)

```

## What did we get?

```{r}
greenspace
```
## Why?

What's with all the NAs?

Remember, we set all water cells to NA, to ignore them in our analysis.

## Challenge 5: How do we get extract to ignore our NAs?

Try to run the same command again, but telling the extract function to ignore NAs.

## Solution

The `na.rm` argument will do this for us. See how the docs indicate that it is set to FALSE by default? 

```{r, eval = FALSE}
?raster::extract
```

Good to know!  Also good to know that this is a common
argument across a variety of R operations.

## Solution

```{r}
#extract the mean nlcd_simple values to tract polygons,
#this time setting na.rm to TRUE
greenspace = extract(nlcd_green, sftracts, fun=mean, na.rm = T)

#and add to our sftracts dataframe (which we can do because order is preserved)
sftracts$prop_greenspace = greenspace

```
## Get the mean home values in each tract

Pulling code from the end of Part II of this workshop, let's aggregate our homes data to the tract level too.

```{r}
#aggregate totvalue to sftracts
sftracts_w_mean_val = aggregate(x = SFhomes15_sf['totvalue'],
                                by = sftracts,
                                FUN = mean)
#and add the totvalue column to our sftracts dataframe
sftracts$mean_totvalue = sftracts_w_mean_val$totvalue
```

## Get the mean home values in each tract

```{r}
qtm(sftracts_w_mean_val, fill = 'totvalue')

```

## Predicting home values

Do mean elevation and proportion greenspace predict mean home values?

(__Note__: This is not a statistically valid model! Just a stand-in for downstream analysis.)

```{r}
mod = lm(mean_totvalue ~ mean_elev + prop_greenspace, data = sftracts)
summary(mod)
```

## Predicting home values

Not at the census-tract level. But that's kind of coarse...

What if we want to do the analysis at the property level?

Here's a workflow that puts together a bunch of what we've learned over
Parts I to III of the workshop!

```{r}
#Take a random subset of our 2015 homes, to save on computer time
SFhomes15_sample = SFhomes15_sf[sample(seq(nrow(SFhomes15_sf)),
                                replace = FALSE, size = 2000), ]
```

## Predicting home values

Now let's reproject all our data to a UTM projection, so that we units of meters rather 
than decimal degrees.

```{r}
#reproject
SFhomes15_utm <- st_transform(SFhomes15_sample, 26910)
DEM_utm = projectRaster(DEM,
                        projectExtent(DEM,
                                      crs(st_crs(SFhomes15_utm)$proj4string)))
nlcd_green_utm = projectRaster(nlcd_green,
                               projectExtent(nlcd_green,
                                             crs(st_crs(SFhomes15_utm)$proj4string)))

#check projections
st_crs(SFhomes15_utm) == st_crs(DEM_utm)
st_crs(SFhomes15_utm) == st_crs(nlcd_green_utm)
```

## Predicting home values

Now let's buffer all our homes with a 100-meter buffer, then sum the greenspace within
those buffers.

```{r}
#create buffer
SFhomes15_utm_buff = st_buffer(SFhomes15_utm, dist = 100)

#sum the greenspace within the buffers 
#NOTE: This will take a couple minutes to run...
greenspace_homes = extract(nlcd_green_utm, SFhomes15_utm_buff, fun = mean, na.rm = T)

#add that as a column in our SFhomes15_utm dataframe
SFhomes15_utm$greenspace = greenspace_homes

## Predicting home values

And now let's extract the elevation at each home.

```{r}
#extract the elevation to the homes
#NOTE: no need for fun or na.rm arguments here, because the homes
#and points, not polygons, so only a single cell will extract to each
elev_homes = extract(DEM_utm, SFhomes15_utm)

#add that as a column in our SFhomes15_utm dataframe too
SFhomes15_utm$elev = elev_homes

```

## Predicting home values

**Now**, how about that regression model?

```{r}
mod = lm(totvalue ~ elev + greenspace, data = sfhomes15_utm)
```

## Predicting home values

Mehhh... Some signal for elevation, but a very low $R^2$.

But again, this is just a stand-in for downstream analysis.

```{r}
summary(mod)
```

# Section 3: RasterStacks and RasterBricks

## RasterStacks

What about working with multiple rasters?

## Fog data

Data on summertime coastal fog in CA (a.k.a. Karl)
```{r}
#(from http://climate.calcommons.org/dataset/monthly-summertime-fog)
#(units are in average hours per day)
karl_files = unique(gsub('.aux.xml', '', list.files('./data/CalMnYr')))
karl_files = karl_files[grep('flcc', karl_files)]

# Take  a look
karl_files
```

## RasterStack

Read all of the KARL files into one RasterStack object
```{r}
karl <- stack(paste0('./data/CalMnYr/', karl_files))

# look at what we made!
karl

```
**A RasterStack object** -  literally what it sounds like!

## Plot the Stack

```{r}
#plot a few
plot(karl[[7:9]])
```

## CRS

What's the projection of the RasterStack?
```{r}

#what's the projection?
st_crs(karl)
```

## CRS Transformation

Let's reproject this
```{r}
karl_WGS = projectRaster(karl, projectExtent(karl, crs(st_crs(sftracts)$proj4string)))

# check resultant CRS
st_crs(karl_WGS) == st_crs(sftracts)

```


##  What did we get?

What type of spatial object did that give us?

```{r}
karl_WGS
```

## RasterBrick

A RasterBrick. What does that mean?
```{r, eval = FALSE}

# See the documentation!
?raster::brick

```


## Crop the Brick

Crop it to the extent of our area of interest - SF
```{r}
# Crop it to sftracts
karl_WGS_crop = crop(karl_WGS, sftracts)

#Note that R vectorized that operation across our entire RasterBrick, the same way that it vectorizes many operations, e.g. 3<4 vs 3< seq(4)
```


## Plot it

```{r}
# now let's make our same plot again
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(karl_WGS[[7]])
plot(sftracts, add = T, reset=F, key.pos = NULL, col = NA)
plot(karl_WGS_crop[[7]])
plot(sftracts, add = T, reset = F, key.pos = NULL, col = NA)

```

## Mean Fog

Let's mean the karl values across the RasterBrick
```{r}
# Mean values
mean_karl_WGS_crop = mean(karl_WGS_crop)
```

What did that give us?
```{r}
mean_karl_WGS_crop
```

## RasterBrick to Raster

When we computed the mean of a RasterBrick we got back a RasterLayer object! That makes sense, because we took cellwise means across all Layers in our Brick.

**This is called raster algebra**

## Plot it

```{r}
plot(mean_karl_WGS_crop)
plot(sftracts, add = T, col = NA)
```


## BUT

Not all common operations successfully run as raster algebra
```{r, eval=FALSE}
# This won't work
sd_karl_WGS_crop = sd(karl_WGS_crop)
```

Let's try this instead
```{r}
sd_karl_WGS_crop = calc(karl_WGS_crop, sd)
```

## Plot it

```{r}
#plot that too
par(mfrow = c(1,2))
plot(mean_karl_WGS_crop)
plot(sftracts, add = T, reset=F, key.pos=NULL, col = NA)
plot(sd_karl_WGS_crop)
plot(sftracts, add = T, reset=F, key.pos=NULL, col = NA)
```

## Thoughts...

Looks like the foggiest neighborhoods also have the highest variation in fog, 
but some less foggy neighborhoods on the east side of the city
(e.g. The Inner Mission, Bayview) also vary quite a bit

## Extract Mean Values

Extract fog values to our tracts
```{r}
sftracts$mean_karl = extract(mean_karl_WGS_crop, sftracts, mean)
```


## Explore Spatial Relationships

Maybe fogginess is a function of elevation? That would make sense, right?

```{r}
# Linear regression model
mod = lm(mean_karl ~ mean_elev, data = sftracts)
```

## View results
```{r}
summary(mod)
```

## Comments

Neat!

Census-tract mean elevation has a significant, positive effect on
mean fogginess (with each meter increase in elevation causing on average
a .011 hour, or about 39-second increase in time spent in fog on an average
summer day.

Though this barely explains about 4% of the variance in our data!

Of course, again, these are __not statistically valid models!__ Just analytical stand-ins.
